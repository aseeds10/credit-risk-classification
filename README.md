# Credit Risk Analysis Report

## Overview of the Analysis

In this analysis, I evaluate a model based on loan risk. I used a dataset of historical lending activity 
from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of 
borrowers.
<br>
To determine creditworthiness, I looked at the other features in the current company dataset to train the model
to predict a client's potential loan status using actual clients' loan statuses (healthy vs unhealthy loans).
Current loan status is used as the indicator for creditworthiness in this model.
<br>
The variables ("features") used to train the model are listed below:
* Loan Size (loan_size)
* Interest Rate (interest_rate)
* Borrow Income (borrower_income)
* Debt to Income (debt_to_income)
* Number of Account (num_of_accounts)
* Derogatory Marks (derogatory_marks)
* Total Debt (total_debt)
<br>
<br>
Below is a brief overview of the stages of the machine learning process I went through as part of this 
analysis:
<br>
1. Loading dataset (csv) into analysis tool of choice (in this case python using libraries like pandas 
and scikit learn). 
<br>
2. Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets - this allows you to use a part of the real consumer data
to train the model and the other to test whether the model is predicting creditworthiness in a satisfactory 
manner. I used train_test_split from scikit-learn for this step, amongst other functions.
<br>
3. Create a (Logistic Regression) model with the original data.
<br>
4. Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance by generating a confusion matrix (evaluates true and false positives and
negatives) and a classification report (looks at accuracy and precision of model).
<br>
I decided on the LogisticRegression model algorithim for this machine model due to [DO NOT LEAVE BLANK]


## Results

    * Description of Model 3 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.

## Summary
In summary, I found that the [WRITE MOST ACCURATE MODEL] was the best one for this use. This model [WRITE 
REASONS HERE; SEE BELOW]

[Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:

* Which one seems to perform best? How do you know it performs best?
* Does performance depend on the problem we are trying to solve? (For example, is it more important to predict the `1`'s, or predict the `0`'s? )

If you do not recommend any of the models, please justify your reasoning.]
